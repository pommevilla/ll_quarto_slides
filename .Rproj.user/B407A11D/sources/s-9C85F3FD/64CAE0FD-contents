## My R/Rmarkdown Experience

I started using RMarkdown when I joined my lab at Iowa State.

# Why Quarto??

![](images/but-why.gif)

## Lot of great technical reasons...

-   Sometimes hard to know which package to use for which output format
-   Want to expand the ecosystem/allow people from other languages to take advantage of Rmarkdown
-   Still have to learn, but it's all encompassed within one API - all you'll need is Quarto

## ...but today I'm going to show you the cool stuff

-   Things you'll love: live preview, styling, rendering a project

# What is Quarto?

> Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy to write plain text format.

## Built on Pandoc

That's good, right?

## Multiple languages

Currently supports Python and R, with Julia maybe coming eventually

## Using the same languages and syntax you know about

So it's easy to get started

# Demonstrations

## RMarkdown Workflow

## Jupyter Lab Workflow

# Bonuses

## New Python Project integration in Rstudio

## Playing with Github Pages

# Workbench example site
