# Example Jupyter notebook

Just some example text.

Here's some Python code.

for x in range(10):
    print(f'{x} squared is {x **2}.')


Let's make a figure.


```
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig.cap: A line plot on a polar axis.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])

ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

A cool thing about Quarto is that we can cross reference figures, too. If we add the `fig.cap` option to the figure above, we can reference it later.

 > See @fig-polar to see an example of a projection of a straight line into polar coordinates.
