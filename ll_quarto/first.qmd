This is my first Quarto doc.

Quarto uses Markdown, so all the Markdown you know translates here.

## I can make headers

We can *italicize* and **bold** text.

We can link to images

![Add image captions...](images/vic.jpg "...and add alt text.")

And since it's based on RMarkdown, you can do all the R stuff you're used to as well.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```

We can also throw some Python in here.

```{python}
print([x ** 2 for x in range(10)])
```

## Math stuff

We can also write math stuff!

> We say $f$ is continuous at $x$ if for all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $|x - x_0| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon$.
