## Where did I start using

# Why Quarto??

![](images/but-why.gif)

## Hits

## Lot of great technical reasons...

-   Reinvest in the ecosystem

-   Wanted to add these features/address these problems

-   Put cool things in context of current "challenges"

-   Visual Markdown editor

-   Sometimes hard to know which package to use for which output format (can be overwhelming)

-   Mostly for R people - expand the ecosystem - allows people from other language to take advantage of Rmarkdown

-   Still have to learn, but it's all encompassed within one API - all you'll need is Quarto

-   That's why we're/the company/I am excited

-   3 things I love: live preview, styling, rendering a project

## ...but today I'm going to show you the cool shit

# What is Quarto?

> Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy to write plain text format.

## Built on Pandoc

That's good, right?

## Multiple languages...

Python, R, etc

## Multiple outputs...

HTML, slides, pandoc, blah

## Using the same languages and syntax you know about

So it's easy to get started

# Demonstrations

-   RMarkdown Workflow
-   Jupyter Lab workflow
-   Output formats

# Workbench Example

Let's go to the website.

# Bonuses

## New Python Project integration in Rstudio

## Pushing to Github pages

### Visual Editor

# Questions?
